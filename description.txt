Adds durability limits to weapons and armor. Formula for computing durability (approx. # of uses):
- Sell value of = x, Avg hits per second = y:
    ( (y/4 * x^1.54) / (5 + x) ) + 50
- Value of valueless items: (dmg * 1000 + def * 1000) * rarity
- Increases 2x if item is a tool or armor.
- Repair items via. reforging, armor via. smithing.
- NEW (2.0) Items degrade with repairs.
